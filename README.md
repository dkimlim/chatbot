# Chatbot

## Project

A fully customized chatbot created with [Botpress](https://github.com/botpress/botpress). This chatbot serves as a FAQ for customers interested in a vintage business. I was inspired by my last job, where several repetitive messages were sent to us everyday. The project is still under development.
